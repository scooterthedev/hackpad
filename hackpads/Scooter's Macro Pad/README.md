# Scooter's Macro Pad

This is my macro pad that I will most likely use to semi-automate my workflow and maybe some hotkeys for tasks. It has a OLED screen with 12 switches, a rotary encoder, and 4 LED's for that cool bottom glow effect plus a cool feature that I though of. This is expansion board pogo pins. These pins will allow
me to in the future, make an expansion board and all I need to do is connect the pogo pins from that board to the ones on the main board, write firmware for it, and TADA!

Even though I would consider myself fairly advanced in PCB design as I have made multiple complicated circuit boards in the past, this macro board definitely took along time to make (like more than a week just for the PCB and half the case), and it will definitely take me even longer to hand solder the components onto the 3 boards, but it was definitly fun to make, a huge learning experiance, and totally worth my time!

# BOM For The Case
If all the parts can be 3D printed in Black PLA that would be awesome! If not, any solid color will work.
